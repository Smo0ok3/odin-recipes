    <p> If these pancakes were any lighter, they would float off the plate </p>
    <ul>
        <li> 3/4 cup cold water or milk</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup ricotta cheese </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest( just the yellow part of the skin) </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li> 1 large egg </li>
        <li> 1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons melted butter </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon lemon juice </li>
        <li> 1 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons self-rising flour</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, lemon zest, vegetables oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. Add melted butter, lemon juice, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour. Whisk together, stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter.</li>
        <li> Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minute</li>
        <li> Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to look dry (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.</li>
